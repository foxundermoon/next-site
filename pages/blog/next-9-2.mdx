We are excited today to introduce the production-ready Next.js 9.2, featuring:

- **[Built-In CSS Support for Global Stylesheets](#built-in-css-support-for-global-stylesheets)**: Applications can now directly import `.css` files as global stylesheets.
- **[Built-In CSS Module Support for Component-Level Styles](#built-in-css-support-for-global-stylesheets)**: Leveraging the `.module.css` convention, locally scoped CSS can be imported and used anywhere in your application.
- **[Improved Code-Splitting Strategy](#improved-code-splitting-strategy)**: The Google Chrome team heavily optimized Next.js' code-splitting strategy, resulting in much smaller client-side bundles. Furthermore, they've maximized [HTTP/2](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/http2) utilization to improve page load speed without hurting HTTP/1.1 performance.
- **[Catch-All Dynamic Routes](#catch-all-dynamic-routes)**: Next.js' Dynamic Routes now support catch-all routes, supporting a variety of new use-cases, e.g. CMS-powered websites.

All of these benefits are non-breaking and fully backwards compatible. All you need to do to update is run:

<TerminalInput
  prefix
>{`npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest`}</TerminalInput>
