We are excited today to introduce the production-ready Next.js 9.2, featuring:

- **[Built-In CSS Support for Global Stylesheets](#built-in-css-support-for-global-stylesheets)**: Applications can now directly import `.css` files as global stylesheets.
- **[Built-In CSS Module Support for Component-Level Styles](#built-in-css-support-for-global-stylesheets)**: Leveraging the `.module.css` convention, locally scoped CSS can be imported and used anywhere in your application.
- **[Improved Code-Splitting Strategy](#improved-code-splitting-strategy)**: The Google Chrome team heavily optimized Next.js' code-splitting strategy, resulting in much smaller client-side bundles. Furthermore, they've maximized [HTTP/2](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/http2) utilization to improve page load speed without hurting HTTP/1.1 performance.
- **[Catch-All Dynamic Routes](#catch-all-dynamic-routes)**: Next.js' Dynamic Routes now support catch-all routes, supporting a variety of new use-cases, e.g. CMS-powered websites.

All of these benefits are non-breaking and fully backwards compatible. All you need to do to update is run:

<TerminalInput
  prefix
>{`npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest`}</TerminalInput>

### Built-In CSS Support for Global Stylesheets

Next.js now has native support for importing stylesheets into your application.
Prior to this support, is was necessary to use custom configuration, a CSS-in-JS solution, or manually append `<link>` tags.

To add a stylesheet to your application, import the CSS file within `pages/_app.js`.

For example, consider the following stylesheet named `styles.css`:

```css
body {
  padding: 20px 20px 60px;
  margin: 0;
}
```

Create a [`pages/_app.js` file](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app) if not already present.
Then, [`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) the `styles.css` file:

```jsx
import '../styles.css'

// This default export is required in a new `pages/_app.js` file.
export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}
```

Since stylesheets are global by nature, they must be imported in your [Custom `<App>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app).
This is necessary to avoid class name and ordering conflicts.

In development, expressing stylesheets this way allows your styles to be hot reloaded as you edit themâ€”meaning you can keep application state.

In production, all CSS files will be automatically concatenated into a single minified `.css` file.
This CSS file will be loaded via a `<link>` tag automatically injected into your application.

If you were previously using `@zeit/next-css`, you may now remove the plugin from your `next.config.js`.
